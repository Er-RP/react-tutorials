#### Active Route were done.

1. We can easily achieve active link styles using `NavLink` component from **react-router-dom**
   and `isActive` prop.

2. `NavLink` component will be automatically apply _active_ class to current route. e.g **Home**

3. We can also set custom style in inline using the `isActive` prop. e.g **About**

4. Also we can apply custom class using the `isActive` prop. e.g **Products**
