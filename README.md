# Getting Started with React Routing

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

#### Nested Routing were done.

1. in `App.js` nested routes are wrapped inside parent route

2. `<Outlet />` from the **react-router-dom** used to render the nested routes.

3. We have fixed parent route only content (JSX only render in parent route) by adding **index** route inside parent route
